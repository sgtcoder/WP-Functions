## Overview
I have worked on many WordPress projects and there are a list of functions I see myself having to write in every project. Until now, there is now a composer for it!

## Installation
This project assumes that you have general knowledge of a LAMP stack environment.
- Add this repository to your composer.json (since it's not in packagist.org)
```
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://github.com/sgtcoder/wp-functions.git"
    }
]
```
- Run `composer install sgtcoder/wp-functions`

## Setup
- Look at the `/vendor/sgtcoder/wp-functions/src/functions.php` file for functions

## Future
- More Functions will be added
